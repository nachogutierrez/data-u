trap 'rm -f "$filename"' EXIT

# Read from stdin and write to temporary file

# Replace 'your_command' with the actual command that needs the tmp file path
# Example: if you need to pass the temp file to a script, you could do something like:
# ./your_script.sh "$tmp_file"
# cat "$tmp_file"
gcloud app deploy $filename

# The temporary file will be deleted automatically when the script exits
